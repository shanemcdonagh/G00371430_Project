# Mobile Application Year 2 Project: NBA Information &amp; Statistics App 

## Introduction

Hello, and welcome to my **Mobile Application Development** project. 

This applications purpose is to provide information on basketball, specifically the **National Basketball Association League** (NBA). The reason for this theme is due to my passion for the sport and was the first idea that came to mind upon learning that we had creative control over the application theme.

This application will be used to showcase all that I've learned throughout this module in one, _intuitive_ application. The application also includes some features that were not discussed within the module, which were implemented independantly.

Witin this repository is a user guide on how navigate the application. This wiki page will describe all pages within the application in detail, while providing the user with simple instructions on how to use the application to its fullest.

 ### To note

- All formatting and code was developed with **Ionic Lab** in mind. To view the application in its intended form, please view through this feature

- Data within this application is retrieved and read from jsonblob.com, which removes data that has not been accessed in 150 days. For this reason I have provided a text file containing the information as necessary. This in turn will future proof the application for ease of use
