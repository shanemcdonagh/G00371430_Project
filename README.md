# Mobile Application Year 2 Project: NBA Information &amp; Statistics App 

To note: 

- All formatting and code was developed with Ionic Lab in mind, to view the application in it's fullest, please view through this feature

- JSON data is retrieved and read from jsonblob.com, which removes data which has not been accessed in 150 days. For this reason I will provide a text file 
with raw data. This in turn will future proof the application if needed
